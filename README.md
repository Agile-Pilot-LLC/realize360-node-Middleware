This repository hosts the code for the back end server of a software application which is intended to respond to Realize 360 interface requests. 
The back end server is built on top of Node.JS with Express, along with a large list of plugins installed. These plugins enable access to things such Google Cloud databases, environment variables, and REST communication.

It was made public because the project is no longer receiving development support or funding and thus privacy is no longer needed to protect intellectual property.
